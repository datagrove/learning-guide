# Datagrove Learning Guide
The Learning Guide repository is a template for organizing notes and resources. Datagrove employees or contributors who pursue learning about a specific topic may use the Learning Guide repo to collect and share learning resources.

## Using This Repo
* Clone and rename the Learning Guide repo rather than forking it so that you can create new copies when learning about different topics
* Write actual code! Practice learning by doing, and plan to write and commit some code every day - even if it doesn't work yet
* Remember that Datagrove is committed to transparency and open source development - please do not include any proprietary, private, or sensitive information in your Learning Guide
* Please complete and keep all sections in the `Contents` section - the `Using This Repo` section may be deleted in your cloned repo if desired

Use this space to outline how you plan to share your new knowledge. The Learning Share Plan should be as specific as possible, including dates, times, platforms, media, etc.

Examples include:
* I will host a virtual learning share session on Sept. 1 from 2:00-3:00 PM EST on Discord that is open to anyone who wishes to attend.
* I will write a blog post of approximately 2,500 words and submit it to Medium for publication by Sept. 1 and share it with the team.
* I will will use iMovie to create a ten-minute tutorial video with code examples by Sept. 1 and share it with the team.
* I will create a tutorial slidedeck in Google slides approximately 10 slides long with step by step instructions, code snippets, and recommended resources by Sept. 1 and share it with the team.
* I will create a live code demo hosted on Heroku by Sept. 1 and share it with the team.
